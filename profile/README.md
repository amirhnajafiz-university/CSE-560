# :racehorse: Stallion 

**Stallion** is a Message Broker that is implemented with **Go programming language**.
You can use **Stallion** to publish events on specific topics and consume them over client side with **Stallion SDKs**.
Stallion provides authentication so you can authorise your clients before sending events to them.

One good thing about **Stallion** is that it uses only Golang internal modules and has no external modules.
Everything in **Stallion** is pure Golang.
